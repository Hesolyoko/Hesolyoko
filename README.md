## Hey! Welcome to my profile! 🙋‍♂️

Here's a bit about me:
 
- 🎮 I’m currently working on Game Dev, on the UGJ #100 and São Paulo's Game Jam Plus Online Site!
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently learning Unreal 4 and 5, and the newer versions of Unity.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with deepening my knowledge on those tools, and any others that might come to create the best games I can!
- 💭 Currently I have 2 of 11 planned games in some form of development, they being: 
      Homemade Havoc: Story of the "robot warrior"...
      The game about a cook who has to fight zombie-behaving cultists.
- 🌙 Fun facts: Aside from gaming, I have quite the interest for astronomy, and I hope to contribue somehow to this field!
                I also weirdly have an idea for a TV Series, which I might create the script along with the games, who knows!
